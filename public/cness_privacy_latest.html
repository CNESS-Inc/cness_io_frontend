<p><strong>Cookies and Other Automatic Data Collection Technologies</strong></p>
<p>CNESS and its partners use cookies or similar technologies, which store certain information on your computer and allows us to, among other things, analyze trends, administer the Website, and to gather demographic information about our user base. The technology used to collect information automatically from CNESS users may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cookies: </strong>Like many websites, we and our operational partners, analytics, and service providers use &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer&rsquo;s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use both persistent cookies that remain on your computer or similar device, and session ID cookies, which expire at the end of your browser session. We also use cookies to enhance the reliability, security and performance of our Website, including cookies are passed by our Web Application Firewall. When you visit our website, we may present a cookie banner asking for your consent to use non-essential cookies. You can manage your preferences through our cookie settings. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functionality of the Website.</li>
<li><strong>Web Beacons: </strong>Web beacons are small graphics with a unique identifier that may be invisible to you, and which are used to track the online activity of Internet users.</li>
<li><strong>Embedded Scripts: </strong>An Embedded Script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Service.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising IDs:</strong>We collect your Apple Identifier for Advertising (IDFA) or Google Advertising ID (AAID) (depending on the operating system of your device) when you access our Website from a mobile device. You can typically reset these numbers through the settings of your device's operating system (but we do not control this).</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Cookies</strong></p>
<p>CNESS uses third-party vendor tracking cookies, pixels, and other technologies to collect data about your activities when you visit our Website, the website of entities for which we serve advertisements, or the websites and online services where we display advertisements. This information may include the content you view, the date and time that you view this content, the products you purchase, or your location information associated with your IP address. We use the information we collect to serve you more relevant advertisements (sometimes referred to as &ldquo;Retargeting&rdquo; or &ldquo;Remarketing&rdquo;). We collect information about where you saw the ads, we serve you and what ads you clicked on to measure the success of our advertising campaigns. You can generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third-party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance&rsquo;s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (DAA) by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website (<a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/"><u>http://optout.networkadvertising.org</u></a>) and DAA website (<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/"><u>http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</u></a>).</p>

We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Services. Google Analytics collects only the I.P. address assigned to you on the date you visit this Website, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this Website, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google&rsquo;s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this Website is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google&rsquo;s Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this Website by disabling cookies on your browser.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track Signal</strong></p>
<p>Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. We do not honor browser requests not to be tracked online (known as &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo;), but our cookie policy below describes how you can opt out of receiving cookies.</p>
<p></p>

<li><strong>Contact Us:</strong>You may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@cness.io"><u>support@cness.io</u></a>to learn more about your rights and choices regarding your Personal Information.</li>
</ul>
<p><em></em></p>
<p>Please be aware that if you do not allow us to collect Personal Information from you, we may not be able to deliver certain experiences, products, and services to you, and some of our Services may not be able to take account of your interests and preferences.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Depending on where you are located, you may have certain rights regarding your Personal Information (also known as &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; under applicable data protection laws). Residents of certain jurisdictions may access, correct, update or delete your Personal Information; object to our processing of this information, ask us to restrict our processing of your Personal Information, or request portability of your Personal Information. Please see the <strong>YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION </strong>and<strong>the YOUR CHOICES REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION </strong>sections of this Notice<strong></strong>to learn more about exercising your rights.</p>
<p>Upon request, CNESS will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your Personal Information.

<p></p>
<p>We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your requests for deletion; however, certain residual information may actively persist on the Service even if you close your account. In addition, the rights described above may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal Personal Information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information, we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping (such as for fraud prevention purposes). Your Personal Information may remain in our archives and information you update or delete, or information within a closed account, may persist internally for our administrative purposes, to the extent permitted by law. It is not always possible to completely remove or delete information from our databases. In addition, we typically will not remove information you posted publicly through or on the Service. Bear in mind that neither you nor CNESS can delete all copies of information that has been previously shared with others on the Service. If your information is deleted, then your account may become deactivated. If your account is deactivated or you ask to close your account, you will no longer be able to use the Services.</p>
